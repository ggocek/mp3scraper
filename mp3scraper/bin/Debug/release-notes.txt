Added maxWebRequests attribute to limit the number of web requests against a
single host. This limits the number of valid MP3s linked in the RSS results.
This is used to simply limit the size of the RSS and the number of MP3 web
requests, and helps when the host limits the number of web requests per unit
unit of time.
